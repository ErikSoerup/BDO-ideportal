To get the app running, you will need to edit the following files to customize everything for your environment:

    config/environment_custom.rb
    config/database.yml
    config/newrelic.yml       (if you want performance metrics from NewRelic)
    config/twitter.yml        (if you want Twitter integration)
    config/facebooker.yml     (if you want Facebook integration)

To customize the UI, edit / create files in the following directories:

    app/views/custom/
    public/stylesheets/sass/
    public/images/

UI elements that pertain to your brand need not be contributed back to the open source project.

==================

To set up the database, if you are using MySQL, you'll need to make sure the user configured in database.yml
has permission to use the "load data" command:

    grant file on *.* to bbyidx;

To set up the database:

    rake db:create   # if you haven't created it already through your DB admin tool
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

You will be prompted to provide an email address and password for the admin user.

Now give your installation a test drive!

    script/server
    
To verify your installation:

    rake test

moved repo to BBYOpen. Testing pull into forks. Testing pull again.

Had issues with test heroku account "bdodev".

As a collaborator, using command 'heroku logs' did not show me the actual errors. 
So communicated with heroku support people and they sent the stack trace that they found using the command:
"heroku ps:dynos 1"
This helped me understand the issue with the application. There were multiple conflicted files committed to heroku, 
due to which the application server was not getting started and was giving following error
"Error H14 (No web processes running)"

So I resolved all the conflits and committed back the code to bdodev.heroku
And the application worked with no errors.
