To customize the open source version for your project, edit the following files:

    config/environment_custom.rb
    config/database.yml
    config/gmaps_api_key.yml
    config/newrelic.yml
    config/twitter_config.yml (if you want Twitter support)
    config/facebook*.yml (if you want to experiment with Facebook; currently not supported)

To customize the UI for your project, fill in the files in the following directories:

    app/views/custom/
    public/stylesheets/sass/
    public/images/

UI elements that pertain to your brand need not be contributed back to the project
